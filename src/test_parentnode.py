class TestParentNode(unittest.TestCase):

    """
    

    Basic Test:
        A ParentNode with a simple tag and one child.

    Multiple Children:
        A ParentNode with multiple LeafNode children, each having its own tag.

    Missing Tag:
        Attempting to call to_html on a ParentNode without a tag, expecting a ValueError.

    No Children:
        Attempting to create or convert a ParentNode without any children should raise a ValueError.

    Nested ParentNodes:
        ParentNode having other ParentNode instances as children, testing the recursive aspect.

    Children with None Tags:
        ParentNode containing LeafNode children with None as their tag, ensuring these render correctly.

    Empty Properties:
        A ParentNode with no properties (props being optional) to ensure it defaults correctly.

    Complex Nesting:
        Deeply nested hierarchy of ParentNode and LeafNode instances to test recursion depth.

    Invalid Child Structures:
        Passing non-LeafNode or non-ParentNode objects in the children list.

    Edge Case with Empty Strings:

    Edge case where tag or value is an empty string.
